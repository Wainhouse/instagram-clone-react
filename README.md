<h1>instagram-clone-react</h1>

<h2>First solo project.</h2>

<p>I'm independently learning ReactJS, Firebase and NodeJS alongside the QA Software Development Bootcamp.</p>

<p>This app was created to replicate the experience which Instagram offers. Users can make account, passwords and eventually post photos (debugging the post.js), all through firebase</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p> - Create an account
    - Login into account
    - pull new posts from database
    - Comment (eventually)
    - Post photos (eventually)
    
Bare with me, my debuggin skills are skill intermediate
